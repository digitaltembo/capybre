   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Capybre's documentation!
===================================

A thin pythonic wrapper around some of Calibre's command line features for ebook-manipulation and information. 

Right now, it can:
* convert ebooks
* extract metadata (including cover image) from an ebook file
* fetch metadata (including cover image) from various internet sources given some identifying information

All with a simple call to the python library!
